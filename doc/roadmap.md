# Roadmap

This file is the **execution plan** for Bytewars. The other docs say *what* the game is; this one says *what we build next, in what order, and when we know it's done.*

It is a living document. Update task status as work progresses. If a task changes a decision the docs record, update the docs in the same PR — per `CLAUDE.md`, code and docs must not drift.

## How to read this file

- Work is grouped into **versions** (v0.1, v0.2, …). A version ships when all its milestones are done.
- Each version contains **milestones** (M1, M2, …). Milestones within a version run in **sequence** unless noted otherwise.
- Each milestone contains **tasks**. Tasks marked **(parallel)** can be picked up independently at the same time.
- Each task has: **status**, **track**, **depends on**, **inputs**, **outputs**, **acceptance**, and optional **notes**.
- **Status** values: `todo` · `in-progress` · `blocked` · `done`.
- **Track** values: `foundation` · `logic` · `ui` · `render` · `integration`.

## v0.1 — Walking Skeleton (done)

v0.1 established the three-layer architecture (logic / ui / render), proved the end-to-end pipeline (gambits → resolver → event log → DOM playback), and shipped a hardcoded 2v2 fight visible in the browser. All tasks are done.

---

## v0.2 — Gambit Editor + Visual Combat Feedback (done)

v0.2 shipped a per-unit gambit editor (searchable dropdowns, drag-to-reorder, unit tabs) wired to the combat resolver, plus combat visual feedback (active unit highlight, target indicator projectile, idle state visual, scrolling combat log). The one-shot flow editor → fight shipped; no map or rewards. All tasks done, `pnpm check` passes.

---

## v0.3 — Audio (done)

v0.3 added a Web Audio API synthesis layer (`src/audio/`): synthesized sounds for attack, damage, and destroy events; a looping background beat during combat; win/lose stingers at fight end. No audio asset files. Audio is wired to combat playback from `CombatScreen` — the render layer stays audio-free. All tasks done, `pnpm check` passes.

---

## v0.4 — Map + Multi-Battle Run (done)

v0.4 shipped the full run loop: player squad loaded from editable `src/content/player-squad.json` (Zod-validated), seeded branching map (horizontal SVG graph, max 3 lanes, 10–12 combat + boss nodes), HP carry-over between fights (dead units sit out one fight and return at 42%), Overseer boss chassis, game-over and victory screens, and the complete `map → gambit-editor → combat → result` state machine in App.tsx. All tasks done, `pnpm check` passes.

---

## v0.5 — Named Attacks, Cooldowns, and Per-Attack Sound (done)

v0.5 replaced the generic `attack` action with 6 named attacks across 4 chassis (`quick_jab`, `sweep`, `taser`, `overload`, `clamp`, `suppression`), each defined in Zod-validated `src/content/attacks.json` with its own damage, cooldown, initial cooldown, and synthesized Web Audio sound. Cooldowns are tracked in `CombatState` and gate reuse; the gambit interpreter falls through blocked rules silently. The gambit editor shows only chassis-valid attacks with damage/cooldown info and a round-1 warning where `initialCooldown > 0`, and the combat log displays human-readable attack names. All tasks done, `pnpm check` passes.

---

## v0.6 and beyond

Likely themes: reward selection screen, additional chassis (Lawnbot, Security-drone), vocabulary expansion (new conditions + target selectors), reach rules, modules, Elite node type, Repair Bay node, flavor text between nodes, status effects, meta-progression.
